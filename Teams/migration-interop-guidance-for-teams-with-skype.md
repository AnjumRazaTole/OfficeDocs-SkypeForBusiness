# Migration and interoperability guidance for organizations using Teams together with Skype for Business

> [!Tip] 
> Watch the following session to learn about [Coexistence and Interoperability](https://aka.ms/teams-upgrade-coexistence-interop)

As an organization with Skype for Business starts to adopt Teams, administrators can manage the user experience in their organization using the concept of coexistence "mode" which is a property of TeamsUpgradePolicy. Using mode, administrators manage interop and migration as they manage the transition from Skype for Business to Teams.  A user's mode determines in which client incoming chats and calls land as well as in what service (Teams or Skype for Business) new meetings are scheduled in. In the future, mode will also be used to define Teams client behavior in terms of what functionality will be available. 


## Fundamental concepts

1.  *Interop* : 1 to 1 communication between a Lync/Skype for Business user and a Teams user.

2.  *Federation* : Communication between users from different tenants.

3.  All Teams users have an underlying Skype for Business account that is “homed” either online or on-premises:
    - Users already using Skype for Business Online use their existing online account.
    - Users already using Skype for Business/Lync on-premises use their existing on-premises account.
    - Users for whom we cannot detect an existing Skype for Business account will have a Skype for Business Online account automatically provisioned when the Teams user is created. No Skype for Business license is required.

4.  If you have an on-premises deployment of either Skype for Business or Lync, and you want those users to be Teams users, you must at a minimum ensure that Azure AD Connect is syncing the msRTCSIP-DeploymentLocator attribute into AAD, so that Teams/Skype for Business Online properly detects your on-premises environment. Furthermore, to move any users to Teams-only mode (i.e., upgrade a user), *you must first configure Skype for Business hybrid mode*. For more details, see [Configure Azure AD Connect for Skype for Business and Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/SkypeForBusiness/hybrid/configure-azure-ad-connect).

5.  Interop between Teams and Skype for Business users is only possible *if the Teams user is homed online in Skype for Business*. The recipient Skype for Business user can be homed either on-premises (and requires configuring Skype for Business Hybrid) or online. Users who are homed in Skype for Business on-premises can use Teams in Islands mode (defined later in this doc), but they cannot use Teams to interop or federate with other users who are using Skype for Business.  

6.	Upgrade and interop behavior are determined based on Coexistence mode of a user, which is managed by TeamsUpgradePolicy. TeamsInteropPolicy is no longer honored and granting mode=Legacy is no longer allowed. 

7.  Upgrading a user to the TeamsOnly mode ensures that all incoming chats and calls will always land in the user's Teams client, regardless of what client it orignated from. These users will also schedule all new meetings in Teams. To be in TeamsOnly mode, a user must be homed online in Skype for Business. This is required to ensure interop, federation, and full administration of the Teams user.To upgrade a user to TeamsOnly:
        - If the user is homed in Skype for Business online (or never had any Skype account), grant them TeamsUpgradePolicy with Mode=TeamsOnly using the "UpgradeToTeams" instance using PowerShell, or use the Teams Admin Center to select the TeamsOnly mode.
        - If the user is homed on-premises, use `Move-CsUser` from the on-premises admin tools to first move the user to Skype for Business Online. There are 2 options when moving users from on-premises:
    
       - If you have Skype for Business Server 2019 or CU8 for Skype for Business Server 2015, you can specify the `-MoveToTeams` switch in `Move-CsUser` to move the user directly to Teams. This option will also migrate the user's meetings to Teams (although for now, meeting migration is only functional for TAP customers). 
       - Otherwise, after `Move-CsUser` completes, assign TeamsOnly mode to that user using either PowerShell or the Teams Admin Center.  
    For details see [Move users between on-premises and cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/move-users-between-on-premises-and-cloud).  For more details on meeting migration, see [Using the Meeting Migration Service (MMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/setting-up-the-meeting-migration-service-mms).


8.	To use Teams Phone System features with Teams, users must be in TeamsOnly mode (i.e., homed in Skype for Business Online and upgraded to Teams), and they must either be configured for Microsoft Phone System [Direct Routing](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/Direct-Routing-is-now-Generally-Available/ba-p/210359#M1277) (which allows you to use Phone System with your own SIP trunks and SBC) or have an Office 365 Calling Plan.   

9.  Scheduling Teams meetings with Audio Conferencing (dial-in or dial-out via PSTN) is currently available only for users who are homed in Skype for Business Online. Support for Teams users with an on-premises Skype for Business account is in TAP.


## Coexistence modes

Interop and migration are managed based on “coexistence mode” using TeamsUpgradePolicy. A user’s mode determines:

- *Incoming routing*: In which client (Teams or Skype for Business) do incoming chats and calls land? 
- *Meeting scheduling*: Which service is used for scheduling new meetings and ensuring that the proper add-in is present in Outlook. Note that TeamsUpgradePolicy does not govern meeting join. Users can always *join* any meeting, whether it be a Skype for Business meeting or a Teams meeting.
- *Client experience*: What functionality is available in Teams and/or Skype for Business client? This is implemented for TeamsOnly mode. Support for other modes is planned for the future. 

The modes are listed below. SfBWithTeamsCollab and SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings will allow mixed usage of both clients, but with no overlapping functionality. Islands mode allows usage of both clients, but with overlapping functionality. For example, in Islands mode, a user could initiate a chat in either Skype for Business or Teams, but in SfBWithTeamsCollab, they can only chat in Skype for Business (although they can participate in Teams channel conversations). Note that the Client expeirence for the SfB modes is not yet fully functional.

|||||

**Notes:**

<sup>1</sup> For details on PSTN calling, see table at the end of this document.

<sup>2</sup> SfBWithTeamsCollab and SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings are not yet exposed in the admin user experience because they currently behave no differently than SfBOnly mode, except for controlling the Outlook Add-ins. Once the client experience is delivered, these modes will be available in the Admin Portal. 

## TeamsUpgradePolicy: managing migration and co-existence

TeamsUpgradePolicy exposes two key properties: Mode and NotifySfbUsers. 
</br>
</br>

|Parameter|Type|Allowed values</br>(default in italics)|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Mode|Enum|*Islands*</br>TeamsOnly</br>SfBOnly</br>SfBWithTeamsCollab</br>SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings|Indicates the mode the client should run in.|
|NotifySfbUsers|Bool|*False* or true|Indicates whether to show a banner in the Skype for Business client informing the user that Teams will soon replace Skype for Business. This cannot be true if Mode=TeamsOnly.|
|||||

Teams provides all relevant instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy via built-in, read-only policies. Therefore, only Get and Grant cmdlets are available. The built-in instances are listed below.
</br>
</br>

|Identity|Mode|NotifySfbUsers|
|---|---|---|
|Islands|Islands|False|
|IslandsWithNotify|Islands|True|
|SfBOnly|SfBOnly|False|
|SfBOnlyWithNotify|SfBOnly|True|
|SfBWithTeamsCollab|SfBWithTeamsCollab|False|
|SfBWithTeamsCollabWithNotify|SfBWithTeamsCollab|True|
|SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings|SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings|False|
|SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetingsWithNotify|SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings|True|
|UpgradeToTeams|TeamsOnly|False|
|Global</br>*Default*|Islands|False|
||||

These policy instances can be granted either to individual users or on a tenant-wide basis. For example:
- To upgrade a user ($SipAddress) to Teams, grant the “UpgradeToTeams” instance:</br>
`Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName UpgradeToTeams -Identity $SipAddress`
- To upgrade the entire tenant, omit the identity parameter from the grant command:</br>
`Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName UpgradeToTeams`


## Federation Considerations

Federation from Teams to another user using Skype for Business requires the Teams user be homed online in Skype for Business. Eventually, Teams users homed in Skype for Business on-premises will be able to federate with other Teams users.

TeamsUpgradePolicy governs routing for incoming federated chats and calls. Federated routing behavior is the same as for same-tenant scenarios, *except in Islands mode*.  When recipients are in Islands mode: 
- Chats and calls initiated from Teams land in SfB if the recipient is in a *federated tenant*.
- Chats and calls initiated from Teams land in Teams if the recipient is in the *same tenant*.
- Chats and calls initiated from SfB always land in SfB.


## The intended client user experience in Teams when using SfB modes

When users are in any of the Skype for Business modes (SfBOnly, SfBWithTeamsCollab, SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings), *calling and chat functionality in the Teams app is intended to be disabled*, but currently it is not yet disabled. Similarly, when users are in the SfBOnly or SfBWithTeamsCollab modes, *meeting scheduling in Teams is intended to be disabled*, but it currently is not. A solution to automatically provide this experience is planned.

Until this solution is delivered, administrators can enforce the intended client experience of the TeamsUpgradePolicy mode by manually configuring the values of TeamsMessagingPolicy, TeamsCallingPolicy, and TeamsMeetingPolicy. Furthermore, when using `Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy` in PowerShell, the cmdlet will automatically check the configuration of the corresponding settings in TeamsMessagingPolicy, TeamsCallingPolicy, and TeamsMeetingPolicy to determmine if these settings are compatible with the specified mode. If any are not configured properly, the grant will succeed but a warning will be provided indicating which settings are not configured properly. The administrator should subsequently update the indicated policies to deliver a compatible end user experience in Teams. If the administrator decides to take no action as a result of the warning, users may still have access to chat, calling, and/or meeting scheduling capabilities in Teams depending on the values of TeamsMessagingPolicy, TeamsCallingPolicy, and TeamsMeetingPolicy, which may result in a confusing end user experience.


`PS C:\Users\janedoe> Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -Identity user1@contoso.com -PolicyName SfBWithTeamsCollab
WARNING: The user 'user1@contoso.com' currently has effective policy enabled values for: AllowUserChat, AllowPrivateCalling, AllowPrivateMeetingScheduling, AllowChannelMeetingScheduling. In the near term, when granting TeamsUpgradePolicy with mode=SfBWithTeamsCollab to a user, you must also separately assign policy to ensure the user has effective policy disabled values for: AllowUserChat, AllowPrivateCalling, AllowPrivateMeetingScheduling, AllowChannelMeetingScheduling. In the future, the capability will automatically honor TeamsUpgradePolicy.
PS C:\Users\janedoe>`


Prior to delivery of the automatic enforcement of client behavior described above, each of the SfB modes behave essentially the same. The SfBOnly, SfBWithTeamsCollab, and SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings modes are all identical in how they route incoming calls and chats. The only difference, for now, is in whether the Outlook Addins for Teams and Skype for Business are enabled. Until the differentiated client experiece is delivered, only 1 of the SfB modes is enabled in the Admin Portal. But all modes are available in PowerShell.


### PowerShell warning matrix

This table shows the policy settings that are checked when TeamsUpgradeMode is granted. In the future, the intent is for SfBOnly mode to also disable channels in Teams; however, there is currently no setting that allows the channels feature in Teams to be disabled.


|**Modality (App)**|**Policy.Setting**|
|---|---|
|Chat|TeamsMessagingPolicy.AllowUserChat|
|Calling|TeamsCallingPolicy.AllowPrivateCalling|
|Meeting scheduling|TeamsMeetingPolicy.AllowPrivateMeetingScheduling</br>TeamsMeetingPolicy.AllowChannelMeetingScheduling|
|||


The administrator will see a warning if there is a disconnect between the workload enablement and the desired mode. Temporarily, the administrator should enable/disable the workload via the core workload policy.  Once  automatic enforcement based on TeamsUpgradePolicy is implemented, the PowerShell warnings will be updated to inform the administrator that the client experience will automatically apply. In that case, the values of TeamsMessagingPolicy, TeamsCallingPolicy, and TeamsMeetingPolicy remain unchanged – but the intended client experience will be enforced according to TeamsUpgradePolicy.



## TeamsInteropPolicy and Legacy Mode being retired 

TeamsInteropPolicy has been replaced by TeamsUpgradePolicy. All components that previously honored TeamsInteropPolicy have been updated to honor TeamsUpgradePolicy instead.  Microsoft had previously introduced the “Legacy” mode in TeamsUpgradePolicy to facilitate the transition from TeamsInteropPolicy to TeamsUpgradePolicy. In Legacy mode, routing components that understood TeamsUpgradePolicy would revert back to TeamsInteropPolicy. Routing now fully supports TeamsUpgradePolicy and Legacy mode is no longer supported. *Customers using Legacy mode must update their configuration of TeamsUpgradePolicy to use one of the other modes.* 


### Action required for organizations that are using Mode=Legacy and/or TeamsInteropPolicy
Customers using mode=Legacy in TeamsUpgradePolicy (policy instance = NoUpgrade or policy instance = NotifyForTeams) must update their configuration to use a policy with a mode other than legacy.  In addition, customers using TeamsInteropPolicy should remove any assignments of this policy since it is no longer used by the system.  Note that is it is no longer possible to grant Legacy mode. 

Required Actions:
 - Customers using TeamsInteropPolicy with users that are *not* in Legacy mode: the policy has no effect and it's recommend you remove any user level assignments and just use the global policy with default values.
 - Customers using Legacy mode with TeamsInteropPolicy routing to SfB (DisallowOverrideCallingSfbChatSfb):   These organizations should switch to use one of the SfB modes (SfBOnly, SfBWithTeamsCollab, SfbWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings) in TeamsUpgradePolicy. From a routing perspective, any of these modes behaves the same as using Legacy mode with TeamsInteropPolicy routing to SfB.
  - Customers using Legacy mode with TeamsInteropPolicy routing to Teams (DisallowOverrideCallingTeamsChatTeams): These organizations should switch to TeamsOnly mode.  From a routing perspective this will be have the same. One difference however, is that users in Teams Only mode will no longer be able to initiate chats and calls, nor schedule meetings in Skype for Business. However they can still join any Skype for Business meeting.


 **Microsoft requests that customers remove all use of Legacy mode by November 15, 2018.** Sometime after that, Microsoft will be removing  instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy with mode=Legacy.</br>
